## Render Crime Map From CSV 

This is a desktop map application that uses ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET. 

The data for this map is stored in a csv file under Data folder of the project which has several attributes like latitude, longitude, crime type etc. When the application loads a graphics layer is created with the location data and rendered onto the map. User can select a particular type of crime from a list box to highlight those features on the map.
